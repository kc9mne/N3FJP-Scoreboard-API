=^.^=
An advanced web based scoreboard and stats for N3FJP logging programs. Built on my original project but enhanced to directly use the API and remove all the database swaping.
Can be run on a small SBC or on the server PC itself. Includes light and dark mode as well as the ability to pause the slider. Designed to be viewed fullscreen at 1080p on a tv or laptop.
popup notifications for contact goals and animations for qso rates for fun.
